Answers to Algos:
1. O(n^3)...the n*n*n is a giveaway

2. O(log n)...the i =1/2 is a giveaway...makes it a log function

3. O((N^0.5)/2)...which would be less than O(log n)..not quite sure what this would be

4. O((log n)^2)...whcih is a steeper function just log n

5. O(n^4)...the vaiables being +1 of the previous don't matter

6. O(n)..this is just a recursion n times of something..stopping at 0

7. same as #6.

8.
